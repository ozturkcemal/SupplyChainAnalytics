        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The Streamlit application `app.py` was successfully created to calculate Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and total inventory cost using user inputs for fixed ordering cost, holding cost, and demand rate.\n",
        "*   Initial attempts to run the application encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `streamlit`, indicating the library needed to be installed.\n",
        "*   Streamlit execution context issues, such as warnings about `ScriptRunContext` and `Session state does not function when running a script without streamlit run`, were observed when the code was not run as a standalone script using the `streamlit run` command.\n",
        "*   `ngrok` tunneling faced persistent authentication failures (ERR_NGROK_4018), which were resolved by prompting the user for their `ngrok` authtoken and successfully setting it using `ngrok.set_auth_token()`.\n",
        "*   A public URL was successfully generated via ngrok, making the Streamlit application accessible after addressing all dependency and authentication requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   For future deployments, explicitly include `streamlit` as a required package installation step to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n",
        "*   To enhance user experience, provide clear instructions or a dedicated field for the `ngrok` authtoken, emphasizing the need for a verified account.\n"
